## The purpose of creating the Targeted Vector
In the past, I made a Python game called "Shilang Hunter" in 2024. However, we found that there was a significant problem with the efficiency. So I decided to create a new game called "Targeted Vector" to solve this problem.

## How to Contribute to Targeted Vector
Targeted Vector is an open-source project, It's normal to want to contribute to Targeted Vector. However, I do not expect anyone to contribute codes to the Targeted Vector itself in the development phase. Because Targeted Vector is moving at the pace of my development and it will be confusions if someone wants to contribute codes to the Targeted Vector.

*While I don't expect anyone to contribute code to the target vector itself during the development phase, I do expect anyone to contribute bug reports and feature suggestions.*

You can contribute to Targeted Vector in the following ways:
1. Submit bug reports and Feature Suggestions: If you encounter any bugs while playing Targeted Vector or have any feature suggestions, please create an issue in the GitHub repository or send it directly to me (Cheple_Bob@outlook.com).

## Special Thanks
