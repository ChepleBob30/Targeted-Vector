Due to the development time factor, the content of the Chinese version of the README is more complete than that of the English version. If you find any translation problems in the English version, please raise an issue and give me feedback.

## The purpose of creating the Targeted Vector

I made a Python game called "Shilang Hunter" in 2024. However, the performance of "Shilang Hunter" is too poor (it causes severe lag when running on any device), so I decided to rewrite a game with better performance and more complete content in Rust.

## How to Contribute to Targeted Vector

Targeted Vector is an open-source project. However, due to personal factors, I don't want someone to submit the code directly (because this would make the development and code submission work chaotic and difficult).

*But I hope everyone can contribute bug reports and functional suggestions.*

You can contribute to Targeted Vector in the following ways:

1. Submit bug reports and Feature Suggestions: If you encounter any bugs while playing Targeted Vector or have any feature suggestions, please create an issue in the GitHub repository or send it directly to me (<Cheple_Bob@outlook.com>).
